# ocw-directory
This project generates a searchable, sortable HTML table of all MIT OpenCourseWare courses to include course features.
I found a lot of courses didn't have "video lectures" which is what I was primarily interested in.
However, there was not any way to only list courses containing said lectures. Now there is.
